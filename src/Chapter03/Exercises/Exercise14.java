Write a method called cylinderSurfaceArea that accepts a radius and height as parameters and returns the surface area of a cylinder with those dimensions.
For example, the call cylinderSurfaceArea(3.0, 4.5) should return 141.3716694115407.
The formula for the surface area of a cylinder with radius 𝑟 and height ℎ is the following:

    surface area = 2𝜋𝑟^2 + 2𝜋𝑟ℎ

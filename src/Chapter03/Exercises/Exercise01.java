/*
Write a method called 'printNumbers' that accepts a maximum number as an argument and prints each number from 1 up to that maximum, inclusive, boxed by square brackets.
For example, consider the following calls:

    printNumbers(15);
    printNumbers(5);

These calls should produce the following output:

    [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15]
    [1] [2] [3] [4] [5]

You may assume that the value passed to 'printNumbers' is 1 or greater.

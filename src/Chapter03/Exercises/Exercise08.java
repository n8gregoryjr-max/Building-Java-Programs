Write a method called quadratic that solves quadratic equations and prints their roots.
Recall that a quadratic equation is a polynomial equation in terms of a variable 𝑥 of the form 𝑎x^2 + 𝑏𝑥 + 𝑐 = 0.
The formula for solving a quadratic equation is:

    𝑥 = (-𝑏 +/- sqrt(𝑏^2 - 4𝑎𝑐))/2𝑎.

Here are some example equations and their roots:

    𝑥^2 - 7𝑥 + 12 : 𝑥 = 4, 𝑥 = 3
    𝑥 - 3𝑥 + 2 : x = -2, x = -1

Your method should accept the coefficients 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐 as parameters and should print the roots of the equation.
You may assume that the equation has two real roots, though mathematically this is not always the case.

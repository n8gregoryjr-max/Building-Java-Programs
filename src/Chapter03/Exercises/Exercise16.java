Write a method called triangleArea that accepts the three side lengths of a triangle as parameters and returns the area of a triangle with those side lengths.
For example, the call triangleArea(8, 5.2, 7.1) should return 18.151176098258745.
To compute the area, use Heron’s formula, which states that the area of a triangle whose three sides have lengths 𝑎, 𝑏, and 𝑐, is the following.
The formula is based on the computed value 𝑠, a length equal to half the perimeter of the triangle:

    Area = sqrt[𝑠(𝑠 - 𝑎)(𝑠 - 𝑏)(𝑠 - 𝑐)]
    𝑠 = (𝑎 + 𝑏 + 𝑐) / 2

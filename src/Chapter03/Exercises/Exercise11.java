/*
Write a method called distance that accepts four integer coordinates 𝑥1, 𝑦1, 𝑥2, and 𝑦2 as parameters and computes the distance
between points (𝑥1,𝑦1) and (𝑥2,𝑦2) on the Cartesian plane. The equation for the distance is:

    d = sqrt[(x2-x1)^2 + (y2-y1)^2]

For example, the call of distance(1, 0, 4, 4) would return 5.0 and the call of distance(10, 2, 3, 15) would return 14.7648230602334.

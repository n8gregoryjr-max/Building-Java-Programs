A certain bank offers 6.5% interest on savings accounts, compounded annually.
Create a table that shows how much money a person will accumulate over a period of 25 years,
assuming that the person makes an initial investment of $1000 and deposits $100 each year after the first.
Your table should indicate for each year the current balance, the interest, the new deposit, and the new balance.

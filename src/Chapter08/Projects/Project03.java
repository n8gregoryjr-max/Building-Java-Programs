The GroceryItemOrder class should store an item quantity and a price per unit.
A GroceryItemOrder object should have the following methods:

    public GroceryItemOrder(String name, int quantity, double pricePerUnit)

Constructs an item order to purchase the item with the given name, in the given quantity, which costs the given price per unit.

    public double getCost()

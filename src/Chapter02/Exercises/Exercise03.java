/*
The Fibonacci numbers are a sequence of integers in which the first two elements are 1, and each following element is the sum of the two preceding elements.
The mathematical definition of each 𝑘th Fibonacci number is the following:

    F(𝑘) = F(𝑘 - 1) + F(𝑘 - 2), k > 2;      F(𝑘) = 1, 𝑘 <= 2

The first 12 Fibonacci numbers are

    1 1 2 3 5 8 13 21 34 55 89 144

Write a for loop that computes and prints the first 12 Fibonacci numbers.

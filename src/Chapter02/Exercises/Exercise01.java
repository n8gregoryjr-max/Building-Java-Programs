/*
In physics, a common useful equation for finding the position 𝑠 of a body in linear motion at a given time 𝑡,
based on its initial position 𝑠0, initial velocity 𝑣0, and rate of acceleration 𝑎, is the following:

𝑠 = 𝑠0 + 𝑣0 * 𝑡 + 1/2 * 𝑎 * 𝑡^2

Write code to declare variables for 𝑠0,𝑣0,𝑎, and 𝑡, and then write the code to compute 𝑠 on the basis of these values.

/*
Modify your StarFigure program from the previous exercise to become a new program named StarFigure2 that uses a global constant for the figure’s height.
(You may want to make loop tables first.) The previous output used a constant height of 5.
The following are the outputs for constant heights of 3 and 6:

Height 3

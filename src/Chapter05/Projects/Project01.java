/*
Write an interactive program that reads lines of input from the user and converts each line into “Pig Latin.”
Pig Latin is English with the initial consonant sound moved to the end of each word, followed by “ay.”
Words that begin with vowels simply have an “ay” appended.
For example, the phrase

    The deepest shade of mushroom blue

would have the following appearance in Pig Latin:

    e-Thay eepest-day ade-shay of-ay ushroom-may ue-blay

Terminate the program when the user types a blank line.

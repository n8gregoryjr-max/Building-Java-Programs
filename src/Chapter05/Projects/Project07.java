/*
Write a program that plays the dice game “Pig.”
Pig is a two-player game where the players take turns repeatedly rolling a single 6-sided die;
a player repeatedly rolls the die until one of two events occurs.
Either the player chooses to stop rolling, in which case the sum of that player’s roll are added to his/her total points;
or if the player rolls a 1 at any time, all points for that turn are lost and the turn ends immediately.
The first player to reach a score of at least 100 points wins.

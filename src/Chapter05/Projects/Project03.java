/*
Write a program that plays a guessing game with the user.
The program should generate a random number between 1 and some maximum (such as 100),
then prompt the user repeatedly to guess the number.
When the user guesses incorrectly, the game should give the user a hint
about whether the correct answer is higher or lower than the guess.
Once the user guesses correctly, the program should print a message showing the number of guesses that the user made.
Consider extending this program by making it play multiple games until the user chooses to stop
and then printing statistics about the player’s total and average number of guesses.

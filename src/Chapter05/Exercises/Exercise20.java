/*
Write a method called 'digitRange' that accepts an integer as a parameter and returns the range of values of its digits.
The range is defined as 1 more than the difference between the largest and smallest digit value.
For example, the call of digitRange(68437) would return 6 because the
largest digit value is 8 and the smallest is 3, so 8 - 3 + 1 = 6.
If the number contains only one digit, return 1. You should solve this problem without using a String.

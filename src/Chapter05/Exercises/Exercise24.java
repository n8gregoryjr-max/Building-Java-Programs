/*
Write a method called 'isAllVowels' that returns whether a string consists entirely of vowels (a, e, i, o, or u, case-insensitively).
If and only if every character of the string is a vowel, your method should return true.
For example, the call isAllVowels("eIEiO") returns true and isAllVowels("oink") returns false.
You should return true if passed the empty string, since it does not contain any non-vowel characters.

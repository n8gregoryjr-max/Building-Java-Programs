/*
Write a method called 'gcd' that accepts two integers as parameters and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD)
of the two numbers. The GCD of two integers a and b is the largest integer that is a factor of both a and b.
One efficient way to compute the GCD of two numbers is to use Euclid’s algorithm, which states the following:

    GCD(a, b) = GCD(b, a % b)
    GCD(a, 0) = Absolute value of a

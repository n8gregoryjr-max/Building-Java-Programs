/*
Write a method called 'showTwos' that shows the factors of 2 in a given integer.
For example, consider the following calls:

    showTwos(7);
    showTwos(18);
    showTwos(68);
    showTwos(120);

These calls should produce the following output:

    7 = 7
    18 = 2 * 9
    68 = 2 * 2 * 17
    120 = 2 * 2 * 2 * 15

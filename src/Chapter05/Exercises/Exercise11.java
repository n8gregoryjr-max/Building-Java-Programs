/*
Write a method called 'threeHeads' that repeatedly flips a coin until the results of the coin toss are three heads in a row.
You should use a Random object to make it equally likely that a head or a tail will appear.
Each time the coin is flipped, display H for heads or T for tails.
When three heads in a row are flipped, the method should print a congratulatory message.
Here is a possible output of a call to the method:

    T T H T T T H T H T H H H
    Three heads in a row!

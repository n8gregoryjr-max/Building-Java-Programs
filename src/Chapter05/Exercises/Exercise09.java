/*
Write a method called 'printFactors' that accepts an integer as its parameter and uses a fencepost loop
to print the factors of that number, separated by the word "and".
For example, the factors of the number 24 should print as the following:

    1 and 2 and 3 and 4 and 6 and 8 and 12 and 24

You may assume that the parameter’s value is greater than 0, or you may throw an exception if it is 0 or negative.

/*
Write a method called 'randomWalk' that performs steps of a random one-dimensional walk.
The random walk should begin at position 0.
On each step, you should either increase or decrease the position by 1 (each with equal probability).
Your code should continue making steps until a position of 3 or -3 is reached,
and then report the maximum position that was reached during the walk.
The output should look like the following:

    position = 1
    position = 0
    position = –1
    position = –2
    position = –1
    position = –2
    position = –3
    max position = 1

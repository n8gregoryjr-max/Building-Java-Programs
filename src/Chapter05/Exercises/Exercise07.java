Write a method called 'diceSum' that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and prompts for a desired sum,
then repeatedly simulates the rolling of 2 six-sided dice until their sum is the desired sum.
Here is a sample dialogue with the user:

    Desired dice sum: 9
    4 and 3 = 7
    3 and 5 = 8
    5 and 6 = 11
    5 and 6 = 11
    1 and 5 = 6
    6 and 3 = 9

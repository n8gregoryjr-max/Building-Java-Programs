/*
Write a method called 'hopscotch' that accepts an integer number of “hops”
as its parameter and prints a pattern of numbers that resembles a hopscotch board.
A “hop” is a three-number sequence where the output shows two numbers on a line, followed by one number on its own line.
0 hops is a board up to 1; one hop is a board up to 4; two hops is a board up to 7; and so on.
For example, the call of hopscotch(3); should print the following output:

       1
    2     3
       4
    5     6
       7
    8     9
       10

A call of hopscotch(0); should print only the number 1. If it is passed a negative value, the method should produce no output.

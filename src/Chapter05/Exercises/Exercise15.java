/*
Write a method called 'dominant' that accepts three integers as parameters and returns true
if any one of the three integers is larger than the sum of the other two integers.
The integers might be passed in any order, so the largest value could be any of the three.
For example, the call dominant(4, 9, 2) returns true because 9 is larger than 4 + 2.
Assume that none of the numbers is negative.

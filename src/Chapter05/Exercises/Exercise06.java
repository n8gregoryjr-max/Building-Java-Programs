/*
Write a method called 'makeGuesses' that guesses numbers between 1 and 50 inclusive until it makes a guess of at least 48.
It should report each guess and at the end should report the total number of guesses made.
Here is a sample execution:

    guess = 43
    guess = 47
    guess = 45
    guess = 27
    guess = 49
    total guesses = 5

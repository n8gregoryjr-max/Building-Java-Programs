/*
Write a program that prompts for two people’s birthdays (month and day), along with today’s month and day.
The program should figure out how many days remain until each user’s birthday and which birthday is sooner.
Hint: It is much easier to solve this problem if you convert each date into an “absolute day” of year, from 1 through 365.

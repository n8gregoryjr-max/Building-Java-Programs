/*
Write a program that produces a Caesar cipher of a given message string.
A Caesar cipher, or rotation cipher, is formed by rotating each letter of a message by a given amount.
For example, if you rotate by 3, every A becomes D; every B becomes E; and so on.
Toward the end of the alphabet, you wrap around: X becomes A; Y becomes B; and Z becomes C.
Your program should prompt for a message and an amount by which to rotate each letter and should output the encoded message.

    Your message? Attack zerg at dawn
    Encoding key? 3
    Your message: DWWDFN CHUJ DW GDZQ

/*
Write a method called 'quadrant' that accepts as parameters a pair of double values representing an (x, y)
point and returns the quadrant number for that point.
Recall that quadrants are numbered as integers from 1 to 4 with the upper-right quadrant numbered 1 and the subsequent
quadrants numbered in a counterclockwise fashion:

    (+,-) | (+,+)
   -------|-------
    (-,-) | (-,+)

Notice that the quadrant is determined by whether the x and y coordinates are positive or negative numbers.
Return 0 if the point lies on the x- or y-axis.
For example, the call of quadrant(-2.3, 3.5) should return 2 and the call of quadrant(4.5, -4.5) should return 4.

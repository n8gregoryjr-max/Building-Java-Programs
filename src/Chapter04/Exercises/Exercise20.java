/*
Write a method called 'numUnique' that takes three integers as parameters and returns the number of unique integers among the three.
For example, the call numUnique(18, 3, 4) should return 3 because the parameters have three different values.
By contrast, the call numUnique(6, 7, 6) should return 2 because there are only two
unique numbers among the three parameters: 6 and 7.

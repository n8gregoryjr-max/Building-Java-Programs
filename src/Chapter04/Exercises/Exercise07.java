/*
Write a static method called xo that accepts an integer size as a parameter and prints a square of size by size characters,
where all characters are “o” except that an “x” pattern of “x” characters has been drawn from the corners of the square.
On the first line, the first and last characters are “x”; on the second line, the second and second-from-last characters are “x”; and so on.

Here are two example outputs:

    xo(5);	    xo(6);
    xooox	    xoooox
    oxoxo	    oxooxo
    ooxoo	    ooxxoo
    oxoxo	    ooxxoo
    xooox	    oxooxo
                xoooox

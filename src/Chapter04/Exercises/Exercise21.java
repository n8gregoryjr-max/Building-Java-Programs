/*
Write a method called 'perfectNumbers' that accepts an integer maximum as its
parameter and prints all “perfect numbers” up to and including that maximum.
A perfect number is an integer that is equal to the sum of its proper factors,
that is, all numbers that evenly divide it other than 1 and itself.

For example, 28 is a perfect number because 1 + 2 + 4 + 7 + 14 = 28
The call perfectNumbers(500); should produce the following output:

Perfect numbers up to 500: 6 28 496

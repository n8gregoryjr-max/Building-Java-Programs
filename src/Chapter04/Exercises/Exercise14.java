/*
Modify your 'pow' method from Exercise 5 to make a new method called 'pow2' that uses the type double
for the first parameter and that works correctly for negative numbers.
For example, the call pow2(–4.0, 3) should return –4.0 * –4.0 * –4.0, or –64.0,
and the call pow2(4.0, –2) should return 1 / 16, or 0.0625.

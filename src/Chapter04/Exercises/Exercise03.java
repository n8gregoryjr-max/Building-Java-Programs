Write a method called 'season' that takes as parameters two integers representing a month and day and returns a String indicating the season
for that month and day. Assume that the month is specified as an integer between 1 and 12 (1 for January, 2 for February, and so on) and
that the day of the month is a number between 1 and 31.
If the date falls between 12/16 and 3/15, the method should return "winter".
If the date falls between 3/16 and 6/15, the method should return "spring".
If the date falls between 6/16 and 9/15, the method should return "summer".
And if the date falls between 9/16 and 12/15, the method should return "fall".

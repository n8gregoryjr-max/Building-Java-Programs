/*
Write a method called 'smallestLargest' that accepts a Scanner for the console as a parameter and asks the user to enter numbers,
then prints the smallest and largest of all the numbers supplied by the user.
You may assume that the user enters a valid number greater than 0 for the number of numbers to read.
Here is a sample execution:

    How many numbers do you want to enter? 4
    Number 1: 5
    Number 2: 11
    Number 3: -2
    Number 4: 3
    Smallest = -2
    Largest = 11
